Creating a "Smart Water Manager" system involves various components including IoT sensors for data collection, a server to process the data, and a machine learning model to provide insights and recommendations. For simplicity, let's outline a basic Python program structure that simulates data collection and analysis. This is a high-level simulation and not a direct integration with hardware or machine learning pipelines.

```python
import random
import time
from statistics import mean

# Step 1: Simulate IoT Sensor Data Collection
def get_water_usage_data():
    """
    Simulate the data collection from IoT sensors for water usage.
    This simulates the water flow rate in liters per minute.
    """
    # Simulate data every minute
    return random.uniform(0, 20) # Random water flow rate between 0 and 20 L/min

# Step 2: Analyze Data with Simple Analytics
def analyze_data(data):
    """
    Analyze the water usage data to detect anomalies.
    Simple analysis to find average usage and detect high usage.
    """
    average_usage = mean(data)
    max_usage = max(data)
    
    result = {
        "average_usage": average_usage,
        "max_usage": max_usage,
        "high_usage_alert": max_usage > 15  # Example threshold for high usage
    }
    
    return result

# Step 3: Display Recommendations
def display_recommendations(analysis_result):
    """
    Provide basic feedback based on the analysis.
    """
    print("\n=== Water Usage Analysis ===")
    print(f"Average Usage: {analysis_result['average_usage']} L/min")
    print(f"Max Usage: {analysis_result['max_usage']} L/min")
    
    if analysis_result["high_usage_alert"]:
        print("ALERT: High water usage detected!")
        print("Tip: Consider checking for leaks or reduce water consumption during peak hours.")

# Step 4: Main Function
def main():
    """
    Main function to simulate the Smart Water Manager.
    """
    print("Starting Smart Water Manager...")
    
    # Simulate a day's worth of minute-by-minute water usage data
    water_usage_data = []
    
    try:
        for minute in range(1440): # 1440 minutes in a day
            data_point = get_water_usage_data()
            water_usage_data.append(data_point)
            time.sleep(0.1)  # Sleep to simulate time passage, reduced for demo purposes
            
        # Perform analysis and display recommendations
        analysis_results = analyze_data(water_usage_data)
        display_recommendations(analysis_results)
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Collection Simulation**: 
   - This simulates water usage data, representing liter-per-minute readings from IoT sensors.
   
2. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Computes the average usage and identifies any high usage based on a defined threshold. This doesn't apply sophisticated ML analytics but forms a basic framework.

3. **Recommendations Display**:
   - Provides alerts and simple tips if high water usage is detected.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Basic error handling is implemented with a `try-except` block to capture any unexpected errors during execution.

This simulated version doesn't connect to actual IoT devices or deploy a machine learning model. For a real system, you'd need sensor integrations for data collection (e.g., using `MQTT`, `HTTP`, etc.), and more complex analytics possibly involving a machine learning model trained to detect patterns or forecast usage. This could also involve a backend system to store and process continuous data streams, such as using databases or cloud services.
